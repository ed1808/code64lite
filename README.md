# Code64 Lite

This is a light version of my web app [Code64](https://code64-37hz.onrender.com/).

With this app, you can **encode** and **decode** base64 strings.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)

## Usage

To use this application, you should have installed **Rust** and a JS package manager like **npm**, **yarn** or **bun**.

If you've already installed the required software, just clone this repo and build the app using:

```
npm run tauri build
```
or
```
yarn tauri build
```
or
```
bunx tauri build
```
